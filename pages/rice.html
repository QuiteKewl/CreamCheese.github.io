        <p> &emsp; Ah yes about the elegance of rice. 
            It is harvested on mass and feeds billions of people worldwide.
            There are many distinct versions of rice available however only a few of them are good in the current meta.
            <br>
            &emsp; Look at Sekiro for instance, <a class="ref" href="https://sekiroshadowsdietwice.wiki.fextralife.com/Rice">rice</a> in that game is an overpowered healing item.
            Besides that, it is also used for reaching certain endings.
            That instance alone revealed the many possible usages mankind has put rice to use.
